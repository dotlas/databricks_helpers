# Databricks Workflow Visualization 🚀

## Introduction 📜

This notebook is designed to empower you with the capability to extract invaluable insights from your Databricks workspace. By fetching all the workflows and runs in your workspace, you can gain a deeper understanding of the scheduling, execution, and performance of your tasks. Whether you're interested in the first scheduled run, a specific time range, or overall performance, this notebook has got you covered.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Access to a Databricks workspace.
- Appropriate permissions to access workflows and run information.
- Knowledge of the date range for the analysis.

## Use Cases 🌟

This notebook is perfect for a range of use cases:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on how long your runs are taking and identify potential bottlenecks.

2. **Scheduling Insights**: Understand when your workflows are scheduled and when the first run occurred.

3. **Historical Analysis**: Analyze the historical data of your runs, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.

4. **Resource Allocation**: Optimize your resource allocation based on past performance.

5. **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify runs that failed or took longer than expected.

## Steps 📊

### 1. Fetch Workflows and Runs 🏃‍♂️

This notebook begins by fetching all the workflows in your Databricks workspace. It also retrieves information about the runs that have occurred within a specified date range, which is provided by the user.

### 2. Visualizations 📈

The notebook provides three insightful visualizations:

- **First Scheduled Run of All Workflows**: Visualizes the first scheduled run of each workflow since the start date.

- **Scheduled Runs Between Start and End Date**: Shows all scheduled runs that occurred within the specified date range.

- **All Runs Since Start Date with Time Taken**: Displays all runs that have occurred since the start date, plotting them along with their execution time for performance analysis.

With these visualizations, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your Databricks workflows and runs, helping you make data-driven decisions and optimizations.
