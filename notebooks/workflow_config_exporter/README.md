# Databricks Workspace Job Configuration Exporter 🚀

## Introduction 📜

This comprehensive notebook is thoughtfully designed to assist you in effectively managing your Databricks workspace jobs. It offers a step-by-step guide for fetching job configurations from your current Databricks workspace, parsing and organizing this information, and saving it to a JSON file. The utility of this notebook becomes even more evident when you need to replicate existing job configurations or maintain a detailed version history of your jobs.

## Use Cases 🌟

The versatility of this notebook is evident in a variety of scenarios:

1. **Configuration Replication 🤝**: In cases where there's a need to create new jobs mirroring the configuration of existing ones, this notebook streamlines the process by providing all necessary details in a well-structured format.

2. **Version Control 🔄**: By keeping an organized record of job configurations in JSON files, you establish an effective version control system and gain the ability to closely track changes and historical trends.

3. **Disaster Recovery ☂️**: In the unfortunate event of job configuration loss, workspace migration, or system failures, the saved JSON files act as a reliable resource for rapid and precise job re-creation.

4. **Collaboration 🤗**: Easily share job configurations with your team members, fostering a streamlined and efficient approach to understanding, replicating, and collaborating on job settings.

5. **Audit and Compliance 📊**: Maintain a comprehensive and auditable history of job configurations to meet compliance and regulatory requirements, demonstrating a commitment to transparency and good governance.

Enjoy the remarkable advantages of this notebook, which will greatly enhance your ability to manage, analyze, and maintain control over your Databricks workspace jobs.  

## Prerequisites 🛠️

To make the most of this notebook, it's important to ensure the following prerequisites are in place:

- Access to a Databricks workspace ([Access Token](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/access-control/tokens.html)).
- Appropriate permissions for listing and viewing job configurations.

## Steps 📊

### 1. Fetch Job Configurations 📬

We fetch all the workflows present in your workspace, each fetched workflow config will also contain the individual task config present in the workflow and their respective job cluster configs. [Databricks API documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/list).  

### 2. Parse Information 🧩

In this this we parse the obtained config info. The main thing to keep in mind is that the cluster config contains some fields which are populated after the cluster is initialized but will be fetched anyway from step 1, we need to remove this field or else when we use the same config to create the workflow later it will throw an error. You can also add any custom logic here. For example: You can include webhook notification ID to be associated with a workflow you like, You can also associate an existing all-purpose-compute to a workflow that you want, etc.  

### 3. Save Configuration to JSON 💾

We later save the config to file, if you have a mounted s3 bucket or an azure data lake storage you can direcly specify the path as dbutils will take care of the rest. If you are running the notebook locally then you will need to change the code and use python's inbuilt `open` function to get the task done.
